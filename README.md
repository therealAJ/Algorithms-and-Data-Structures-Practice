# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Practice

******************************************************************************************************************************************



Made this repo for practicing basic algorithms and data structures :)
Notes will be taken as I traverse through my adventure! 
I'll play it safe and use Java for implementation. 

Topics I will attempt to cover:
- An Introduction to Algorithms
- Analysis of Algorithms 
- Arrays 
- Sorting Algorithms 
- Linked Lists 
- Stacks
- Queues 
- Recursion 
- More Advanced Sorting Algorithms 
- Binary Trees 
- Hash Tables 
- Heaps

What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a way of solving well-specified computational problems. An algorithm contains a finite set of  rules that give a sequence of operations for solving a specific type of problem.
